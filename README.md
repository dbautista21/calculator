# Calculator Project
Here I will discuss my progress and any bugs related to the project.

Project works basic calculations. 
Bugs Reported: Calculator stops working when pressing an operation key more than once since it will simply just add the key to the evaluation expression.
This deems the expression incalculable so eventually pressing the '=' button will return an error. 
IE: Pressing 9, - , - , - 8, = will return an error. 

Design Flaw: Probably will start a new branch about this. I'm trying to have a better design on the calculator, followed with maybe a title or something nice 
to be sitting on the top of the calculator. 
Other than that, I'm proud to say the calculator is fully functional. 
Next step after fixing bugs and adding a nice title, would be to allow the page to be resizable and mobile device adaptive.
