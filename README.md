# Calculator Project
Here I will discuss my progress and any bugs related to the project.

Project works basic calculations. 
Bugs Reported: Calculator stops working when pressing an operation key more than once since it will simply just add the key to the evaluation expression.
This deems the expression incalculable so eventually pressing the '=' button will return an error. 
IE: Pressing 9, - , - , - 8, = will return an error. 

Design Flaw: Probably will start a new branch about this. I'm trying to have a better design on the calculator, followed with maybe a title or something nice 
to be sitting on the top of the calculator. 
Other than that, I'm proud to say the calculator is fully functional. 
Next step after fixing bugs and adding a nice title, would be to allow the page to be resizable and mobile device adaptive. 

Objectives: I guess the next thing I could do is create a variable to hold a value of
true or false if a certain key is pressed. 
For example if 3 is pressed, then x. The variable would turn true. Now there has to be a
fork here. If a different operation key is pressed.

Completed a small side thing that is an importan part of the calculator.I integrated how the 
calculator should function if the system will start with a number zero in the beginning.
